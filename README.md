Principal Component Analysis for video compression

This repository contains code for implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for video compression. PCA is a technique used for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving most of its variance, and it is based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

### Background

This project focuses on the classic 1878 video 'Sallie Gardner at a Gallop'. The idea is to showcase the efficiency of PCA in reducing data size while retaining essential information, in a visual way.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Some Octave or MATLAB familiarity
- Basic understanding of PCA and SVD (see for example [my linear algebra course](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~martinez/teaching.html))

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure Octave is installed and properly set up on your system.
3. Place your video files in the designated folder (if needed - additional frame sets are provided for experimentation).
