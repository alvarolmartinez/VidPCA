# VidPCA
Principal Component Analysis for video compression

This repository contains code for implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for video compression. PCA is a technique used for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving most of its variance, and it is based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

### Background

This project focuses on the classic 1878 video 'Sallie Gardner at a Gallop'. The idea is to showcase the efficiency of PCA in reducing data size while retaining essential information, in a visual way.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Some Octave or MATLAB familiarity
- Basic understanding of PCA and SVD (see for example [my linear algebra course](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~martinez/teaching.html))

### Requirements

- Octave [Installation guide]([https://octave.org/](https://octave.org/download))
- JupyterLab [Installation guide]([https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/install))
  
### Installation and Setup
1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Clone the repository using `git clone [repository URL]`. Replace `[repository URL]` with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Prepare Frame Files:**
   - Navigate to the `AlternativeFrameSets` folder in the cloned repository.
   - Place your own frame files (in JPEG format, one for each frame of the video). The repository already includes some frame sets for experimentation.

3. **Open and Run the Notebook:**
   - Open JupyterLab by running `jupyter lab` in your terminal or command prompt.
   - In JupyterLab, navigate to the repository directory and open `VidPCA.ipynb`.
