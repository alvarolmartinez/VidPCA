Principal Component Analysis for video compression

This repository contains code for implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for video compression. PCA is a technique used for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving most of its variance. In the context of video compression, PCA can be applied to reduce the size of video data while retaining its essential information.
